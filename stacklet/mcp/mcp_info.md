## Workflow Patterns
- **Exploration**: Start small with targeted queries, then scale to larger datasets
- **Analysis**: Use SQL for complex analytics, GraphQL for governance operations
- **Scale**: Export large datasets when working with 10K+ records
- **Integration**: Combine asset data with governance results for comprehensive insights

The info tools will guide you through each toolset's specific best practices.
