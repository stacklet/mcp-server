    https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp/issues/932

    It turns out that Claude Code in particular, but other reported LLMs too, have
    some difficulty resisting the temptation to JSON-encode arbitrary parameters.

    This decorator hacks up the function signature of a potential mcp.tool so as to
    advertise support for strings in any argument that doesn't already support them;
    and then, when they're delivered, tries to load the JSON before handing on to the
    actual implementation, so that can continue to see the originally-intended types.

    The conditions which trigger the issue are not well understood, and may vary by
    model; it _may_ be the case that it only happens with (some?) (optional?) params;
    or it may be wisest to decorate _any_ tool which accepts non-str params.
